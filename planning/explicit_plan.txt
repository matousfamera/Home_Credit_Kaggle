[ ] - Deploy the first generation of ensemble model (LGBM, RF, NN)
      [ ] - Tune LightGBM
            [ ] - Use Bayesian hyperparameter tuning
      [ ] - Tune RandomForestClassifier
      [ ] - Tune Tensorflow
      [ ] - Combine the 3 models into 1 notebook
      [ ] - Run a submission on Kaggle

[ ] - Create version 3 notebook - generic notebook where any ensemble models can be created and deployed
      # The notebook will be prepared to handle level 1, level 2 and level 3 ensemble models. At the header of the notebook the models will be specified. The blending operation will be defined.
