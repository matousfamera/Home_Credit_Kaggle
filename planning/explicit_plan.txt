[+] - Create Excel file for submission logging (completed 24-03-31)
      # In this file all submission will be stored. (including model parameters, CV score, LB score) That can give good information about what works and what does not.


[ ] - Download completed dataframe and develop notebooks for importing, and also fix one-hot encoding and filling nan values
      [ ] - Modify LightGBM notebook for export/import dataframe
      [ ] - Modify RandomForestClassifier notebook for export/import dataframe
      [ ] - Modify Tensorflow notebook for export/import dataframe
      [ ] - Modify RF notebook for working one-hot-encoding and nan filling(reached CV about 0.77 with tuning)
      [ ] - Modify Tensorflow notebook for working one-hot-encoding and nan filling



[ ] - Deploy the first generation of ensemble model (LGBM, RF, NN)
      [ ] - Tune LightGBM
            [ ] - Use Bayesian hyperparameter tuning
      [ ] - Tune RandomForestClassifier
      [ ] - Tune Tensorflow
      [ ] - Combine the 3 models into 1 notebook
      [ ] - Run a submission on Kaggle

[ ] - Create version 3 notebook - generic notebook where any ensemble models can be created and deployed
      # The notebook will be prepared to handle level 1, level 2 and level 3 ensemble models. At the header of the notebook the models will be specified. The blending operation will be defined.


[ ] - Develop denoising autoencoder preprocessing as input to nn
