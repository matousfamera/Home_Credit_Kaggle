[+] - Create Excel file for submission logging (completed 24-03-31)
      # In this file all submission will be stored. (including model parameters, CV score, LB score) That can give good information about what works and what does not.


[+] - Download completed dataframe and develop notebooks for importing, and also fix one-hot encoding and filling nan values
      [+] - Modify LightGBM notebook for export/import dataframe
      [+] - Modify RandomForestClassifier notebook for export/import dataframe
      [+] - Modify Tensorflow notebook for export/import dataframe
      [+] - Modify RF notebook for working one-hot-encoding and nan filling(reached CV about 0.77 with tuning)
      [+] - Modify Tensorflow notebook for working one-hot-encoding and nan filling

[ ] - Create a special notebook for Feature Preparation, Engineering
      The notebook will be used for creating features and exporting final dataframe.
      [ ] - Create working Notebook "Home-credit-2024-feature-selection"
      [ ] - Update Kaggle dataset "home-credit-2024-additional-dataset" with exported dataframes
            [ ] - processed_000.parquet, this file includes each and every feature
            [ ] - processed_debug_000.parquet - this file includes just 11k with only about 150 columns, it is for debug purposes
            [ ] - processed_debug_001.parquet - this file includes the 250 best features

[ ] - Deploy the first generation of ensemble model (LGBM, RF, NN)
      [+] - Tune LightGBM
      [ ] - Tune RandomForestClassifier, so far CV=0.77 but idk LB score, it could be overfitted for CV 
      [ ] - Tune Tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/imbalanced_data
      [ ] - Combine the 3 models into 1 notebook
      [ ] - Run a submission on Kaggle

[ ] - Create version 3 notebook - generic notebook where any ensemble models can be created and deployed
      # The notebook will be prepared to handle level 1, level 2 and level 3 ensemble models. At the header of the notebook the models will be specified. The blending operation will be defined.


[ ] - Develop denoising autoencoder preprocessing as input to nn
