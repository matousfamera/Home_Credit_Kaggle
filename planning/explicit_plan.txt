[ ] - THESEUS program
      Many single models will be tested and tried and evaluated. Then different combinations of single models will be tested and evaluated. High-performing metamodels will be tried for submission. There are 4 levels of development
      A - FEATURE ENGINEERING
            We did not focus on feature engineering almost at all. There is big potential in creating new features.
      B - CANDIDATES PREPARATION
            Developing of single models. Before we put the single model in the THESEUS, they have to be tested and evaluated.
            [ ] - LGBM models for each table
            [ ] - CatBoost models for each table
            [ ] - Mixed model (LGBM, CatBoost) , LGBM for numerical values, CatBoost for categorical values

      C - INFERENCE
            Once we have high performing single models, we will try many combinations of the architecture in THESEUS and evaluate it.
            [+] - Implement the idea of adding "prediction" features
            [ ] - Implement metric hacking
      D - SUBMISSION PLANNING
            There is only 30 GPU hours per week. We have to be very selective what to send as submission. We have to be very effecient with the limited GPU time.
            [+] - Run submission of "Notebook Home Credit (LGB + Cat ensemble)-UPDATED-sub"
