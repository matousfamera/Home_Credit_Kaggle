# Kaggle competition - Home Credit - Credit risk model stability

## Description
This competition was one of the biggest competition on the famous Data Science Website Kaggle.com Over 3500 teams joined. More than 5000 participants joined the competition.


## Objective
The goal of this competition is to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The evaluation will favor solutions that are stable over time. Lack of credit history can lead to loan denial, but data science could improve loan accessibility by predicting repayment abilities. Consumer finance providers use scorecards—statistical and machine learning models—to assess loan risk. These must be updated regularly due to clients’ changing behaviors, balancing model stability with performance. Home Credit, since 1997, offers responsible lending to those without credit history, enhancing financial inclusion. Assessing client default risks can help providers approve more loans, aiding those previously excluded. The objective of the “Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability” competition on Kaggle is to create a predictive model that can assess the risk of clients defaulting on their loans, with an emphasis on the model’s stability over time. The challenge is to develop a solution that remains reliable in the long term, helping consumer finance providers to make more informed decisions and potentially extend credit to those who lack a credit history.
